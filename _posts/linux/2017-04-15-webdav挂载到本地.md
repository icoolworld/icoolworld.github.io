# webdav挂载到本地

## centos 安装 davfs2


You have to enable the EPEL repo in order to install that package:
```
yum -y install epel-release
yum -y install davfs2
```

After you're done installing the required packages please disable the epel repo since you are on a cPanel server and this additional repo, at some point might break some package dependencies when cPanel/WHM nightly update is running.

To disable the EPEL repo you can edit /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo file and replace enabled=1 with enabled=0


## 挂载

```
mkdir -p /mnt/webdav
mount -t davfs http://127.0.0.1/dav /mnt/webdav


```
